# AttriCast

#### Hi there! In this project, I have imported a dataset from Kaggle that tracks each User ID with input features and a binary target vector indicating whether or not the employee left the company. I want to use AI to create a predictor model that can take in input features of an employee and output whether or not they will leave the company. In each file, I will deploy a different ML model powered by Scikit-Learn to fulfill this goal.

#### Please download the Kaggle dataset. Next, create a google drive folder called 'AttriCast' and store the Kaggle dataset .csv file in there.


##### Link to Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/employee-attrition-data-prediction

#### I also present a deeper analysis of my code in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-XAzh89aObPVxhGjAmPQFxO3rXge0F4_7kRleVeEviM/edit?tab=t.0
#### In it, I compare and contrast different models and do an evaluation on which one I reccomend for highest accuracy.
