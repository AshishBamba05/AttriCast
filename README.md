# AttriSense

### Hi there! In this project, I have imported a dataset from Kaggale that tracks each User ID with input features and a binary target vector indicating whether or not the employee left the company. I want to use AI to create a predictor model that can take in input features of an employee and output whether or not they will leave the company. In each file, I will deploy a different ML model powered by Scikit-Learn to fulfill this goal.

#### Please download the Kaggle dataset. Next, create a google drive folder called 'AttriCast' and store the Kaggle dataset .csv file in there.
